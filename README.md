# Lord Sygnal

### Premise:

In honor of the first person from whom I learned HTML and some JavaScript, this project is named Lord Sygnal. Lord Sygnal was the character name of an online friend with whom I played the text-based adventure game, Utopia around 2001. The code for this project has been adapted from various sources and from discord.js documentation. Code from which it was refactored was outdated and did not work and so has been updated to function properly as a discord music bot.

### Functions:

  - Queues music from YouTube to play within discord voice chat through typing "!play \<YouTube url\>"
  - Listens for someone to type the word "bye" in chat at which point it plays a sound
  - Demands to be refered to by the title of "Lord" and not just Sygnal
  - Responds to several other key words based on text listening response
